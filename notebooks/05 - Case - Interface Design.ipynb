Test your program with a range of values for <code>length</code>.\n",

    "\n",

    "4\\. Write a function called <code>circle</code> that takes a turtle, <code>t</code>, and radius, <code>r</code>, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling <code>polygon</code> with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of <code>r</code>.\n",
