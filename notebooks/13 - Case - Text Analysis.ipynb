    "    this the small regard harriet which knightley's it most things\n",

    "A series of random words seldom makes sense because there is no relationship between successive words. For example, in a real sentence you would expect an article like “the” to be followed by an adjective or a noun, and probably not a verb or adverb.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis, which characterizes, for a given sequence of words, the probability of the words that might come next. For example, the song Eric, the Half a Bee begins:\n",

    "    Half a bee, philosophically,\n",
    "    Must, ipso facto, half not be.\n",

    "The result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each prefix (like “half the” and “the bee”) to all possible suffixes (like “has” and “is”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any prefix and choosing at random from the possible suffixes. Next, you can combine the end of the prefix and the new suffix to form the next prefix, and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you start with the prefix “Half a”, then the next word has to be “bee”, because the prefix only appears once in the text. The next prefix is “a bee”, so the next suffix might be “philosophically”, “be” or “due”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but you can do Markov analysis with any prefix length."

You can test your program with prefix length two, but you should write the program in a way that makes it easy to try other lengths.\n",
