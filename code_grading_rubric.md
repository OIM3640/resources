# Code Grading Rubric

Each assignment will graded on three dimensions: ***Functionality***, ***Documentation*** and ***Style*** and one ***"WOW!"*** factor. The final assignment grade will be based on a weighted average of each of these grades with weights as follows: 

|   Dimension   | Weight |
| :-----------: | :----: |
| Functionality |  60%   |
| Documentation |  20%   |
|     Style     |  15%   |
|      WOW!     |   5%   |

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
### **Functionality**: 
- Code fully implements all the required features and passes automated unit tests for well-specified assignments.
- For open-ended assignments, the code implements all the required functionality and is easy to run without any modification.
  
### **Documentation**:
- Every function is accompanied by a well-written **docstring** that accurately describes its functionality.
- The **comments** are comprehensive and informative enough to help anyone understand the program without further assistance.
- For open-ended assignments, the program includes a detailed **README** file that explains how to run the program and what it is intended to do.
  
### **Style**: 
- The program is designed with a clear and effective modular structure.
- The code has no cut-and-paste code or magic numbers.
- Variable and function names are chosen sensibly and are self-explanatory.
- The code strictly adheres to the style guidelines laid out in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

### ***WOW!***:
- Reserved for the most impressive solutions that exceed the requirements of the assignment.
- The code goes above and beyond the requirements and impresses the graders with its creativity and innovation.

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### **Functionality**: 
- The code implements all of the required functionality with minor issues in 10-20% of the features for well-specified assignments.
- For open-ended assignments, the code implements all the required functionality and can be run with moderate effort.
- Pseudo-code is properly used.

### **Documentation**:   
- The majority of functions have clear and concise docstrings.
- The comments help to understand the program, but they are not comprehensive.
- For open-ended assignments, there is a **README** file that gives a general overview of the program.

### **Style**: 
  
- The program has an acceptable modular structure with some room for improvement.
- The code includes some cut-and-paste code and magic numbers that could be better eliminated.
- Variable and function names are mostly self-explanatory.
- The code generally adheres to the style guidelines laid out in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## ⭐⭐⭐

### **Functionality**:
- The code implements most of the required functionality, but there are some issues (30-50%) with its implementation.
- Pseudo-code is moderately used for assignments that require it.

### **Documentation**: 
- Docstrings are missing from some of the functions.
- Comments are brief and lack detail.
- For open-ended assignments, it is unclear how to run the program  - a good test is if you have to email someone to ask them how their code runs, they are probably at this level.

### **Style**:
- The program structure is not optimized.
- The code would be a lot cleaner if the author had done a better job thinking through the appropriate functional decomposition. 
- The code includes too much cut-and-paste code and magic numbers.
- Variable and function names are hard to interpret.
- The code follows the style guidelines laid out in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), but with some violations.

## ⭐⭐
### **Functionality**: 
- The assignment is incomplete (~50% of the functionality is not implemented). 
- The functionality that is implemented is not 100% correct.
  
### **Documentation**:
- Documentation mostly is absent.
  
### **Style**: 
- Design is poor. 
- Very little attention has been paid to choosing a sensible functional decomposition. 
- Variable and function names are chosen almost arbitrarily.
- The code does not follow the style guidelines in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## ⭐

###  **Functionality**: 
- Only minimal functionality is present.
  
### **Documentation**: 
- Little or no documentation.
- No comments or *docstrings*. 
  
### **Style**: 
- Code is not readable. 
- Poor choice of variable and function names.
