## Course Description

This course teaches you to **think computationally and build with judgment** in the AI era.

You will learn Python not as a syntax manual to memorize, but as a practical tool to solve problems and work with data. The focus is on **understanding how code works, reading and evaluating solutions** (yours and AI's), **designing effective approaches**, and **communicating technical concepts clearly**.

In 2026, the valuable skill isn't writing code from scratch faster than AI. It's:

- **Judgment**: Knowing what to build and how to evaluate solutions
- **Understanding**: Being able to explain, modify, and improve code
- **Communication**: Articulating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- **Critical Thinking**: Identifying when a solution doesn't make sense

This course prepares you for a world where **AI writes code, but humans make decisions**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply computational thinking to identify and frame problems that can be addressed with programming
- Break down larger problems into smaller, manageable tasks and design effective solutions
- **Read, understand, and evaluate** code written by others and by AI tools
- Write readable, maintainable, and functional Python code to implement solutions
- Use version control and other common development tools (e.g., VS Code, Git/GitHub) to support coding projects
- Work effectively in collaborative environments, including pair programming and peer code review
- Understand how Python can be used for simple web applications and the fundamentals of how the internet works
- Collect, clean, and analyze data to generate business insights
- Present analytical results clearly to support decision-making
- **Collaborate with AI tools** while maintaining independent judgment and critical evaluation
- Build a **public portfolio** of programming and analytical skills that can be showcased to potential employers
- **Reflect on and articulate your learning process**, demonstrating growth over time

## Prerequisites

Students should have a basic understanding of operating a personal computer, including proficiency in using web browsers and the ability to navigate and manipulate files. Additionally, students should be familiar with opening a command prompt or terminal window, editing text files, downloading and installing software. While a basic understanding of programming concepts is preferred, it is not required.

## Learn in Public: Public Repositories

This course embraces the **"Learn in Public"** philosophy. You will create **public repositories** on GitHub for your coursework and projects. This approach:

- Encourages transparency and accountability in your learning process
- Allows easy peer review and collaboration
- **Builds your portfolio from Day 1**
- Reflects modern development practices
- Helps you develop the habit of documenting and sharing your work

**Repository Structure**:

```
oim3640/                     # Main course repository (public)
├── notebooks/               # Jupyter notebooks (from Think Python 3)
├── code/                    # Python scripts and modules
├── data/                    # Data files
├── logs/                    # Learning logs (Markdown files: s01.md, wk04.md, wk05.md, ...)
├── projects/                # Mini projects (may be here or separate repos)
└── README.md                # Portfolio homepage
```

**Important**: You must **frequently commit and push changes**. All coursework is evaluated based on your repository content and commit history, which demonstrates your learning journey and iterative improvement.

## Checkpoints (40%)

Your learning progress is tracked through **at least 6 checkpoints** distributed throughout the semester. Checkpoints are not announced in advance; they occur naturally as part of the course flow.

Each checkpoint may include:

- **Repository review**: Your GitHub repo showing in-class work, notebooks, exercises, mini projects
- **Learning logs**: Quality and depth of your reflections
- **In-person conversations**: Brief interviews where I ask you questions about your code and work to verify understanding

The goal is to assess your **ongoing learning** rather than performance on specific deadlines.

### Learning Logs

After each week, submit a brief **learning log** in Markdown format in your `logs/` folder.

**File naming**: ``wk01.md`, `wk02.md`, etc. (one per week)

**Suggested format** (use as reference, develop your own style):

```markdown
# Week X (Dates) - [Topics]

## What I learned this week
[Brief reflection on key concepts; focus on understanding, not just syntax]

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
[Paste a snippet and explain what it does]

## Challenges I faced
[What was difficult? How did I approach it?]

## AI usage (if any)
[What I asked AI for, how I used/modified the output]

## Questions for next time
[What remains unclear?]
```

**Note**: Your logs are for **your learning** first, grading second. Write honestly about struggles and questions. This demonstrates growth mindset.

**Evaluation**:

- Presence/absence (counts toward checkpoints)
- Depth and honesty (assessed during checkpoint reviews)
- No specific length requirement. Quality matters over quantity

### Mini Projects

Mini projects are **focused explorations** that demonstrate your understanding through building. Each project gives you a direction, not a specific problem to solve. You choose what to build within that direction.

Projects span a range of topics, including:

- Python fundamentals in context (simulations, data processing, etc.)
- Data analysis and storytelling with real-world datasets
- Web applications and API integrations

Each mini project:

- Can be in your main OIM3640 repo or a separate repo
- Follows a milestone structure: Proposal, Prototype, Core Features, Polish
- Requires a `PROPOSAL.md`, `README.md`, and `LEARNING_LOG.md`
- Allows AI assistance but requires you to understand your code and answer questions about it

_Detailed specifications, requirements, and due dates for each mini project will be provided on Canvas and GitHub._

## Understanding Assessment (20%)

Your understanding is assessed through two complementary methods:

### Paper Quizzes

Several in-class paper quizzes throughout the semester. These are **judgment-focused**, not syntax-focused.

**Format**: Paper-based, no electronic devices

**Question Types**:

- **Code Reading**: What does this code do? What's its purpose?
- **Bug Detection**: Find and fix the problem
- **Design Comparison**: Which approach is better? Why?
- **Scenario Analysis**: What data structure would you use? Why?
- **AI Output Evaluation**: Is this AI-generated code trustworthy?

**Philosophy**: Quizzes test your ability to **think about code**, not memorize syntax. You should be able to:

- Read and understand code logic
- Identify potential problems
- Make design judgments
- Evaluate solutions critically

**Policy**:

- No make-up quizzes unless you have a valid medical excuse
- Most quizzes will be announced beforehand
- Focus on recently covered concepts

_Specific quiz dates will be announced on Canvas and in the course schedule._

### In-Person Interviews

Brief conversations during checkpoint reviews where I ask you questions about your code and projects. This gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding verbally and allows me to assess your learning in a more natural, conversational setting.

These interviews:

- Happen naturally as part of the checkpoint process
- No need to schedule separate appointments
- Focus on your repository work, mini projects, and learning journey
- Allow you to explain and defend your design choices

## Final Project (25%)

You will create an independent project that demonstrates your programming and problem-solving skills. This is your main deliverable for the course and an important part of your portfolio.

**Requirements**:

- Must be a functional application (not just code snippets)
- Must include meaningful functionality
- Must be well-documented with clear instructions
- Should demonstrate what you've learned throughout the course
- Can be individual or team-based (depending on scope)

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- Functionality and technical implementation
- Documentation and communication quality
- Depth of learning demonstrated
- Code quality and organization
- Peer collaboration and feedback

_Detailed project specifications, requirements, timeline, and due dates will be provided separately on Canvas and GitHub._

## Participation (15%)

Participation is evaluated based on:

- **In-class engagement**: Active participation in discussions and activities
- **Office hours**: Visiting office hours at least once during the semester (required)
- **Learning log quality**: Depth and honesty of reflection
- **Peer collaboration**: Helping classmates, giving thoughtful code reviews
- **GitHub activity**: Consistent commits demonstrating iterative work

## Bonus Opportunities (up to 3%)

You can earn bonus points through exceptional work that goes significantly beyond course requirements:

- Exceptional mini projects with creative features
- Meaningful contributions to open-source projects
- Organizing study groups or peer learning sessions
- Creating helpful resources for classmates
- Other initiatives discussed with and approved by the instructor

## Course Policies

### Missed Classes

It is mandatory for students to inform the instructor if they will be absent from a class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining all materials and information that were distributed or covered during the class they missed. You are still required to complete in-class exercises and submit learning logs.

### Academic Accommodation

Babson College is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. Any student who may need accommodation(s) based on the impact of a disability should contact the Department of Accessibility Services (DAS) as early in the semester as possible. Accessibility Services staff may be reached by email at <accessibility@babson.edu>, by phone at 781-239-5509, or by visiting Hollister Hall, Suite 220. Accessibility Services staff will coordinate reasonable academic accommodations for eligible students.

### Religious Accommodations

Any student who faces a conflict between the requirements of a course and the observance of their religious belief should contact the instructor early in the semester. In such an event, reasonable accommodations will be provided to the extent they do not create an unreasonable burden on the College.

### Honor Code

Integrity is a core institutional value at Babson. The Babson College Undergraduate Honor Code sets forth clear expectations with regard to how your behaviors, actions, and decision making support our institutional commitment to integrity. The Code, and all that it comprises, aims to build a Community of Honor at Babson - one that is connected and strengthened by each member's individual commitment to integrity and ethical decision making in all that we do. As a Babson student, you are committing to being an active and engaged participant in our Community of Honor, in partnership with your fellow students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

### AI Tools Policy

**AI tools are encouraged and expected** in this course. This includes ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, and other AI assistants.

**Guidelines for Responsible AI Use**:

1. **Use AI freely for learning**: Ask AI to explain concepts, generate practice problems, review your code, suggest improvements

2. **Always understand what you submit**: You should be able to explain the purpose and behavior of any code in your project. Quizzes will verify your actual understanding.

3. **Document AI assistance when required**: Specific requirements for documenting AI usage will be provided with each assignment. This may include comments in code, separate documentation files, or reflection in learning logs.

4. **Critical evaluation is essential**:
   - AI makes mistakes. Please always verify outputs
   - AI may not understand your specific context
   - You are responsible for the correctness of your submissions

5. **What counts as understanding**:
   - You can explain what the code does and why
   - You can modify it to add a feature or fix a bug
   - You can identify potential problems
   - You don't need to memorize every syntax detail

**Remember**: AI helps you build faster, but understanding helps you build better. The goal is learning, not just getting code that runs.

### Academic Integrity

In this course, you are required to abide by the College's Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures as outlined in [Babson's Student Code of Ethics](https://www.babson.edu/media/babson/assets/community-standards/babson-code-of-ethics.pdf). Please review the College's Student Code of Ethics in its entirety, as it is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to ensure your understanding of the Code. Ignorance of the policies is not a valid excuse for any violations.

Academic integrity is important for two reasons. First, independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most they can from their educational experience and the pursuit of knowledge. Second, academic misconduct violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and diminishes the achievements of the entire college community. Accordingly, Babson views academic misconduct as one of the most serious violations of the College's expectations that a student can commit while at Babson College. Specific behaviors that constitute academic misconduct, as defined in the Code, are **cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism, participation in academically dishonest activities, and unauthorized collaboration.**

**In this course specifically**:

- Using AI tools as permitted is **not** a violation
- Submitting work you cannot explain or understand **is** a violation
- Failing to document AI usage when required **is** a violation
- Copying from classmates without attribution **is** a violation

If I am presented with evidence to suggest that you engaged in academic misconduct, I will refer the incident to the [Office of Community Standards](https://www.babson.edu/student-life/community-standards/) for review.

For your coursework, you may be asked to affirm your understanding of and commitment to the academic honesty and integrity expectations set forth in the Code by writing the following pledge:

> "I have abided by the Babson Code of Ethics in this work and pledge to be better than that which would compromise my integrity."

If you have questions relative to academic integrity expectations within the context of a particular assignment, please ask me directly. General questions can be directed to <communitystandards@babson.edu>.

### Conflict Navigation Services

Conflict – especially when working in groups – is a normal, healthy, and expected part of life and ideally is viewed as an opportunity to strengthen relationships, improve efficiency, and rectify underlying concerns that often otherwise go unaddressed. Resolving conflict is a vital part of the educational journey of the Babson student and entrepreneur and requires your active participation and skill development. If you experience interpersonal conflict in this course, I encourage you to explore the [College's Conflict Navigation Services](https://bit.ly/babsonconflictform) as a resource.
