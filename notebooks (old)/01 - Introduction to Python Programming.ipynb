    "# Introduction to Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem solving** is one of the most important skills that everyone should learn and practice. The process of learning to program (especially using Python) is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. \n",

    "\n",
    "> When human beings acquired language, we learned not just how to listen but how to speak. When we gained literacy, we learned not just how to read but how to write. And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to make them. In the emerging, highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the software or you will be the software. It's really that simple: Program, or be programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial; it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or playing a video.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: What are the basic elements of a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language designed by Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "- Python is really (yes, really) easy to learn.\n",
    "- Lot of libraries: network, files, GUI, database...\n",
    "- Python is simple and elegant.\n",

    "### ~~Why Python 3?~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~Short version: Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~- https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/~~\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/. Select the latest version of Python 3.9 (currently Python 3.9.7), click 'download'. **Before clicking 'Install Now', check <b>'Add Python 3.9 to PATH'</b>.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python interpretor\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Depending on your environment, you might start the interpreter by clicking on an icon, or by typing 'python' on a command line. When it starts, you should see output like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python Prompt](python_prompt.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the version number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line is a prompt that indicates that the interpreter is ready for you to enter code. If you type a line of code and hit the Enter key, the interpreter displays the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Code in prompt](intro_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you’re ready to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using IDLE\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE is the standard  Python development environment. Its name is an acronym of \"Integrated DeveLopment Environment\". It works well on both Unix and Windows platforms. It has a Python shell window, which gives you access to the Python interactive mode. It also has a file editor that lets you create and edit existing Python source files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your first Python program\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this exciting journey, I want you to read the following sentences three times:\n",
    "\n",
    "**DO NOT copy/paste other people's code. Type it out!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, start Python interpreter or IDLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the first program you write in a new language is called \"Hello, World!\" because all it does is display the words \"Hello, World!\". In Python, it looks like this:"
