    "\n",
    "For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words. There are lots of word lists available on the Web, but the one most suitable for our purpose is one of the word lists collected and contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby lexicon project (see https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project). \n",
    "\n",
    "The word list we will use is in [resources/code](https://github.com/OIM3640/resources/tree/main/code) on GitHub. Download *words.txt* and put it under folder *oim3640/data*.\n",

It would be great except for the ‘i’ that sneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i. If you could take out those i’s it would work. But there is a word that has three consecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may be the only word. Of course there are probably 500 more but I can only think of one.

In other words, it would have happened 8 times over all. So the question is, how old am I now?”\n",
