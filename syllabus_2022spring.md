## Course Description

Python is a popular, general-purpose, multi-paradigm, open-source, scripting language. It is designed to emphasize code readability – has a clean syntax with high-level data types. While it is easy for beginners to learn, it is widely used in many scientific and business areas for data exploration. This course is an introduction to the Python programming language for students without prior programming experience. We cover data types, control flow, object-oriented programming, and data analysis. The examples and problems used in this course are drawn from diverse areas such as text processing, webpage scraping, and data analytics.

## Course Objectives
Upon successfully completing this course, students will be able to "do something useful with Python":
* Identify/characterize/define a problem
* Design a Python program to solve the problem
* Create executable code
* Build a portfolio of programming skills to show to potential employers
* Read most Python code
* Experience pair programming
* Write basic unit tests
* Enjoy the software development process.


## Prerequisites

Students are expected to be able to open command prompt window or terminal window, edit a text file, download and install software, and understand basic programming concepts.

## Textbook

There are no required texts for his course. All course material will be presented in PPT/PDF/HTML format and posted on Canvas/GitHub. However, students are encouraged to purchase books on Python Programming for reference and additional support, if needed. No prior programming experience is assumed or required.

## Software

At your earliest convenience, download and install the following software:
* Python 3.10.2. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/. Click "Windows installer (64-bit)". After downloading, follow the instruction to finish installation. On the first screen of installation, **enable the "Add Python 3.10 to PATH" option.** If you forget this step, uninstall Python in Settings and reinstall.

## In-Class Exercises: 

Most classes will include a few small hands-on exercises giving you the opportunity to practice what you've just learned under the eyes and guidance of your instructor. Some of you may complete these exercises in class, but, you do have until 11:59 pm the next calendar day (not the next class day) to complete it and sync it. Class Exercises will be graded as _Submitted_, _Excused_, or _Not Submitted_. One automatic excuse is allowed for the semester, with additional excuses at the discretion of the instructor. Please note that in completing the exercises you may obtain help from others, including online sources, but you must understand what you have submitted. Failure to observe this guideline will be considered a violation of Babson's Honor Code.

## Assignments: 

There will be four assignments due. They are to be submitted by 11:59 pm on the due dates, which appear in Canvas at the "Assignments" tab. Submission instructions are included with each assignment. **10 points** will be deducted for each day or partial day that an assignment is late up to four days. The grade for any assignment submitted more than four days late will be zero. Extensions may be granted at the discretion of the instructor if requested in advance. Assignments are considered to be **individual** activities unless other specific instruction is given. If you require help, please contact the instructor. Notice: Your assignment repositories created under course [GitHub](https://github.com/OIM3640) (not your own private repositories) may be modified/deleted by the instructor after semester ends.

## Examination: 

There will be one take-home open-book open-notes examination in the final week. The exam will test your skills and knowledge of Python and program design. 

## Term Project:

An programming project has deliverables due throughout the course of the semester. The goals of the project are:
* To exercise and demonstrate your ability to program using Python
* To exercise and demonstrate your problem solving skills
* To create something useful
* To provide a structure upon which you can apply what you've learned throughout the term

Instructions for the project can be found at the *Term Project* tab in *Canvas*.


## Course Policies

- **Missed Classes**: Students are required to let me know if you are going to miss a class. Any student missing class is responsible for obtaining all material that may have been distributed on class days when he/she was absent.

- **Need for Academic Accommodation**: Babson College is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. Any student who may need accommodation(s) based on the impact of a disability should contact the Department of Accessibility Services (DAS)  as early in the semester as possible. Accessibility Services staff may be reached by email at accessibility@babson.edu, by phone at (781) 239-4075, or by visiting Hollister Hall, Suite 220. Accessibility Services staff will coordinate reasonable academic accommodations for eligible students.

- **Honor Code**: Integrity is a core institutional value at Babson. The Babson College Undergraduate Honor Code sets forth clear expectations with regard to how your behaviors, actions, and decision making support our institutional commitment to integrity. The Code, and all that it comprises, aims to build a Community of Honor at Babson - one that is connected and strengthened by each member's individual commitment to integrity and ethical decision making in all that we do. As a Babson student, you are committing to being an active and engaged participant in our Community of Honor, in partnership with your fellow students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

- **Academic Integrity**:

  In this course, you are required to abide by the College's Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures as outlined in [Babson's Student Code of Ethics](https://www.babson.edu/media/babson/assets/community-standards/babson-code-of-ethics.pdf). Please review the College's Student Code of Ethics in its entirety, as it is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to ensure your understanding of the Code. Ignorance of the policies is not a valid excuse for any violations.

  Academic integrity is important for two reasons. First, independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most they can from their educational experience and the pursuit of knowledge. Second, academic misconduct violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and diminishes the achievements of the entire college community. Accordingly, Babson views academic misconduct as one of the most serious violations of the College's expectations that a student can commit while at Babson College. Specific behaviors that constitute academic misconduct, as defined in the Code, are **cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism, participation in academically dishonest activities, and unauthorized collaboration.** In the instance I am presented with evidence to suggest that you engaged in any of these behaviors, I will refer the incident to the [Office of Community Standards](https://www.babson.edu/student-life/community-standards/) for review.  

  For your coursework, you are required to affirm your understanding of and commitment to the academic honesty and integrity expectations set forth in the Code. You may be asked to write the following pledge on every exam, paper, project, or other academic exercise:

      "I have abided by the Babson Code of Ethics in this work and pledge to be better than that which would compromise my integrity." 

  If you have questions relative to academic integrity expectations within the context of a particular assignment, please ask me directly. General questions can be directed to communitystandards@babson.edu.  

* **Conflict Navigation Services**:
  
  Conflict – especially when working in groups – is a normal, healthy, and expected part of life and ideally is viewed as an opportunity to strengthen relationships, improve efficiency, and rectify underlying concerns that often otherwise go unaddressed. Resolving conflict is a vital part of the educational journey of the Babson student and entrepreneur and requires your active participation and skill development. If you experience interpersonal conflict in this course, I encourage you to explore the [College's Conflict Navigation Services](https://bit.ly/babsonconflictform) as a resource.
