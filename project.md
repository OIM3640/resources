# OIM3640 Problem Solving & Software Design  - Term Project - 2023 Fall

---

## 1. Overview

From now until the end of the semester you will be working with a team of students on a group software project. There will be a demo session on **Thursday, 12/04**. The final submission deadline is **Saturday, 12/09**. 

---

## 2. Project Topic

### Requirements:

- Since this course is (partially) called "Software Design", your project should have a substantial software design component.
- Your final project should be written in Python. It is okay if some amount is written in another language, but the bulk of the project should be implemented in Python. Part of the reason for this requirement is to facilitate peer design reviews.

### Suggestions for Project Topics:

- Since the theme of this course is "Problem Solving", you may want to use this project as an opportunity to explore how computation can be applied to a discipline/problem that you are passionate about. Choosing an interdisciplinary project may also allow your software design project to overlap with work you are doing in other courses (we are fine with this, but we would have to check with the other instructors to make sure this is okay). If you choose to be interdisciplinary, perhaps we can recruit an appropriate faculty angel adviser for your project.
- If you want to have some experience doing a project "for" a client or an organization, talk to faculty and staff on campus. Talk to parents and relatives with real jobs. Perhaps, they have a need that you can help with.
- Make a positive difference in the world. See broken things and fix them.
- A good project should align with your learning objectives. For instance, if you desire to learn how to create a program that can manipulate Excel spreadsheets, select a project that enables you to achieve this particular learning objective.
- An excellent project has a well-defined minimum viable product (MVP) and several opportunities for going beyond it. This will depend on your team's pace and enthusiasm.

## 3. Forming a Team

- Due: 11/03
- The project proposal is worth **3%** of the project grade.

### Requirements

- Your team should consist of no more than two students, although you may opt to work individually if working remotely with others is proving challenging. 
- Please create a new **public** GitHub repository for your team project, with one team member as the creator and the other team member(s) as contributors. **Everyone in the team needs to submit the URL of the project GitHub repository to Canvas.**
- At the beginning of the `README.md` file, please list the names of all team members.
- (Optional) You are advised to establish a Slack channel within our Slack class workspace for easier project communication.
- Your team should schedule a meeting with the professor, or email or message (via Slack) the professor about potential project ideas before the next deadline.
  
### Tips for Team Formation

- Work with people with whom you **share a common interest**, rather than solely working with friends, for best results. We will help with this part of team formation.
- Work with people that want to **devote similar amounts of time to the project.** For instance, if you want to devote your life to making the best most awesomest Software Design project EVER, you should perhaps team up with others with comparable ambition!
- Work with people that **envision a similar style of work on the project.** For instance, if you want to pair-program the entire project, but your peers want to divide the labor and work independently, this probably isn't the greatest setup.

## 4. Project Activities / Deliverables 

### 4.1 Project Proposal

- Due: 11/10
- The project proposal is worth **12%** of the project grade.

Your proposal should contain seven parts, as specified below. The document need not be very long, but the more detail you include, the better feedback we can provide for your team:

1. **The Big Idea**: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.
2. **Learning Objectives**: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
3. **Implementation Plan**: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.
4. **Project Schedule**: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.
5. **Collaboration Plan**: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.
6. **Risks and Limitations**: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?
7. **Additional Course Content**: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?
 
The proposal must be written using [markdown format](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). We recommend checking out [https://markdown-it.github.io](https://markdown-it.github.io) if you need more help with markdown syntax. You need to commit and push this proposal to your project GitHub repository. Everyone needs to submit the URL of the proposal to Canvas for grading purposes.

You should also come to class with a printed version of this proposal. We will have about 10 minutes to meet with each team. You should designate one of the two team members to take notes.

### 4.2 Design Review
- Date: 
- The design review is worth 15% of the project grade (see Technical Reviews page for detailed breakdown)

During the design review, three teams will present their project plans to a panel, and this interactive review format aims to elicit valuable/actionable feedback, rather than being a one-way data dump. In addition to the in-person component of this activity, the review will include a framing/agenda setting document to be submitted before the review date and a reflection/synthesis document after the review.

### 4.3 Code Review
- Date:
- The design review is worth 15% of the project grade (see Technical Reviews page for detailed breakdown)

During the code review, three teams will take turns presenting their code design and architecture to a panel. The review will employ the same interactive format as the design review and focus on soliciting useful/actionable feedback. Like the design review, there will be a framing/agenda setting document submitted before the review and a reflection/synthesis document after the review

### 4.4 Mid-Project Presentation
- Date:
- The mid-project presentation is worth 15% of the project grade (see mid-project presentation rubric)

During your team's mid-project presentation, you'll present the project's progress thus far to the class. This presentation should be formal and well-rehearsed. Successful and professional communication will be the emphasis of this activity. There will be limited time for feedback given in class, although you can submit your feedback online using a feedback form.

### 4.5 Project Website
- Due: 12/08
- The final website is worth 10% of the project grade
  
Your project website is the permanent record of your project's achievements and hopefully a valuable addition to your professional portfolio. You should use all of the above tasks and deliverables to create the final site, incorporating, reformatting, and adding to them to successfully tell the story of your project.

The project website can serve many audiences, including:
- Prospective and current students and faculty
- Parties interested in your project's topic and potential software users
- Future employers
  
There are many successful formats for a project website, but you should consider including:

- **Big Idea/Goal/Why did we do this?**
  
    Can you give a quick and easy explanation of your project's purpose? Consider using a narrative or example use case, such as via screenshots, video, or storyboarding.
    
- **User Instructions/README**
  
    Provide guidance to users regarding downloading, installation, and initial use of your software. [Here](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) is a collection of incredible READMEs that can help you get started. [Here](https://readme.so/) is a website that helps you create a README.

- **Implementation Information**
  
    Code doesn't tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as flowcharts and architectural or class diagrams to explain how your code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to highlight a particularly crucial segment.

- **Results**
  
    Although each project will have unique details, showcasing your software's capabilities is essential! Screenshots and video can be especially useful. Include graphs and data, if appropriate.

- **Project Evolution/Narrative**
  
    By exploring how your project developed over time, you can convey an illustrious story about creating software that improved throughout the process. You might include screenshots or other tools to demonstrate the project's evolution.

- **Attribution**
  
    Ensure that you give appropriate credit for any external resources you used in your project.

**Note**: These prompts are intended to inspire your thinking, and you should choose whatever sections and organization make sense for your project and the story you're sharing. Merely answering the prompts one-by-one may not be the most effective way to communicate your work to an external audience. Consider what you've accomplished and frame it in a visually appealing way - finish with a bang!

Your final project website may be implemented using whatever platform you like. You can continue to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or explore other options like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/pricing) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

### 4.6 Code Submission
- Due: 12/09
- Project code is worth 35% of the project grade. Please refer to the Code Grading Rubric for more details.
  
Project code must be submitted to GitHub. In case there are environmental variables that are ignored in the GitHub, please send an email to the professor to provide the necessary information.

As a part of your submission, make sure to include a **README.md** file that describes how to run your code, such as any required dependencies, like libraries to install, and input files. We recommend taking a look at these resources like [Awesome READMEs](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) and [Readme.so](https://readme.so/) to help you get started on creating an informative README file.

Although it is optional for this project, proper documentation is essential to your final product. It would be best to generate documentation from the docstrings, and you can do this using tools such as [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/pydoc.html). If you want to generate truly beautiful documentation, check out [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) (the tool used to generate the Python documentation).

Make sure that your code gives appropriate attribution to external resources used. If you have any questions about this, just ask. 

### 4.7 Final Demo/Presentation Session
- Date: 12/04
  
We will meet for a demo session of your final projects. It is an opportunity for everyone to share their final projects, and it will not be a part of the evaluation. This is not mandatory.
