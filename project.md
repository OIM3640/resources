# OIM3640 Problem Solving & Software Design  - Term Project - 2021 Fall


## 1. Overview

From now until the end of the semester you will be working with a team of students on a group software project. There will be a demo session on **Thursday 12/02**. The final submission deadline is **Friday 12/10**. 

---

## 2. Project Topic

### Requirements
- Since this course is (partially) called "Software Design", your project should have a substantial software design component.
- Your final project should be written in Python. It is okay if some amount is written in another language, but the bulk of the project should be implemented in Python. Part of the reason for this requirement is to facilitate peer design reviews.


### Suggestions for Project Topics
- Since the theme of this course is "Problem Solving", you may want to use this project as an opportunity to explore how computation can be applied to a discipline/problem you care deeply about. Choosing an interdisciplinary project may also allow your software design project to overlap with work you are doing in other courses (we are fine with this, but we would have to check with the other instructors to make sure this is okay). If you choose to be interdisciplinary, perhaps we can recruit an appropriate faculty angel adviser for your project.
- If you want to have some experience doing a project "for" a client, talk to faculty and staff on campus. Talk to parents and relatives with real jobs. Perhaps, they have a need that you can help with.
- Make a positive difference in the world. See broken things and fix them.
- A good project is one that meets your learning goals. For instance, if it is really important to you to learn how to create a program with a GUI, you should make sure that your project topic aligns with this learning goal.
- A good project is one that has a realistic and well-defined minimum deliverable as well as many opportunities for going beyond the minimum deliverable (depending on the pace and enthusiasm of the team).

## 3. Teaming
### Requirements
- You are required to work on a team of 2-3 students. You can also choose to work individually if you experience difficulties working with others remotely.
- **One** team member needs to create a new public GitHub repository for team project. **Others fork** this repository.
- Team needs to create a **Slack channel** for project communication in Slack class Workspace. 
- Team needs to **schedule a time** to meet with professor.
- Team needs to briefly talk to professor about potential project ideas via email or Slack.
  
### Team Formation Advice
- **Try to work with people because you share a common interest** rather than simply working with your friends (we will do a structured activity to help with this aspect of team formation).
- **Work with people that want to devote similar amounts of time to the project.** For instance, if you want to devote your life to making the best most awesomest Software Design project EVAR, you should probably work with other people that share your ambition!
- **Work with people that envision a similar style of work on the project.** For instance, if you really want to pair-program the entire project, but your teammates prefer to divvy up the work and work independently, that is probably not a good situation.

## 4. Project Activities / Deliverables 

### 4.1 Project Proposal
- Due: 10/05
- The project proposal is worth **10%** of the project grade.

You should come to class with a document that describes the main idea of your project. We will have about 10 minutes to meet with each team, so we ask that you come to the meeting without your laptop, but with a printed version of your document. You should designate one of the two team members to take notes. 

You should push this proposal to your project GitHub repository. I recommend you use [markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for this proposal. Your proposal should contain the seven sections listed below. We don't expect this proposal to be very long, but the more detail you provide here the better help and feedback when can provide your team:

1. **The Big Idea**: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?
2. **Learning Goals**: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
3. **Implementation Plan**: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.
4. **Project schedule**: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.
5. **Collaboration plan**: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.
6. **Risks**: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?
7. **Additional Course Content**: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?



### 4.2 Design Review
- Date: 
- The design review is worth 15% of the project grade (see Technical Reviews page for detailed breakdown)

We will be holding a design review that will have three teams taking turns presenting their plans for their project. This review is intended to very interactive, and will focus on soliciting useful/actionable feedback rather than being a one-way brain dump. In addition to the in-person component of this activity, there will be a framing/agenda setting document due before the review and a reflection/synthesis document due after. 

### 4.3 Code Review
- Date:
- The design review is worth 15% of the project grade (see Technical Reviews page for detailed breakdown)

We will be holding a code review that will have three teams taking turns presenting their code design and architecture. This review is intended to very interactive, and will focus on soliciting useful/actionable feedback rather than being a one-way brain dump. In addition to the in-person component of this activity, there will be a framing/agenda setting document due before the review and a reflection/synthesis document due after.

### 4.4 Mid-Project Presentation
- Date:
- The mid-project presentation is worth 15% of the project grade (see mid-project presentation rubric)

Halfway through the project your team will present the progress with the project to the class. This is intended to be a formal / polished presentation. The focus of this activity will be around successful and professional communication. There will be limited time for feedback in class, but you can communicate your feedback electronically using feedback form.


### 4.5 Project Website

- The final website is worth 10% of the project grade
  
Your project website is the lasting record of what you have accomplished over the course of this project, and hopefully a valuable contribution to your professional portfolio. You should draw upon all the deliverables and activities above to create the final site, combining, reformatting, and adding to them to effectively tell the story of your project.

The project website can serve many audiences, including:
- Current and future students and faculty
- Potential users of your software and those with a domain-specific interest in your topic
- Future employers
  
There are many successful formats for a project website, but you should consider including:
- **Big Idea/Goal/Why did we do this?**
  
    Quick and easily understandable explanation of what your project is all about. Consider including a narrative or example use case, e.g. via screenshots, video, or story boarding.
- **User instructions/README**
  
    Information to help users download, install, and get started running your software. [Here](https://github.com/kautukkundan/Awesome-Profile-README-templates) is a collection of awesome README templates to get some ideas.

- **Implementation information**
  
    Code doesn't tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as flowcharts and architectural or class diagrams to explain how your code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to highlight a particularly crucial segment.

- **Results**
  
    Though the details will be different for each project, show off what your software can do! Screenshots and video are likely helpful. Include graphs or other data if appropriate.

- **Project evolution/narrative**
  
    Tell an illustrative story about the process of creating your software, showing how it improved over time. This may draw upon what you learned from the two peer technical reviews. Consider the use of screenshots or other tools to demonstrate how your project evolved.

- **Attribution**
  
    Give proper credit for external resources used.

**Note**: These content prompts exist to inspire your thinking, and you should use whatever organization and sections make sense for your project and the story you're telling. Simply answering the given prompts sequentially is not the strongest way to communicate your work to an external audience. Think about what you've accomplished and frame it nicely - finish strong!

Your final project website may be implemented using whatever platform you like. You can continue to use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), or you can switch to an easier option like [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new).


### 4.6 Code Submission
- Due: Friday, 12/10
- Project code is worth 35% of the project grade (see code rubric on the Code Grading Rubric)

Project code must be submitted via GitHub. You must include a **README** describing how to run your code, including any required dependencies (e.g. libraries to install) and any input files. [Here](https://github.com/kautukkundan/Awesome-Profile-README-templates) is a collection of awesome README templates to get some ideas.

Proper documentation is important to your final submission, and one way to ensure you have adequate docstrings is to generate documentation from them. You can do this using [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/pydoc.html). If you want to generate truly beautiful documentation, check out [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) (the tool used to generate the Python documentation).

Make sure that your code gives appropriate attribution to external resources used. If you have any questions about this, just ask.


### 4.7 Final Demo / Presentation Session
- Date: Thursday, 12/02
  
We will meet for a demo session of your final projects. This session is for everyone to share what they've created, and will not be evaluated.
