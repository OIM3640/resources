# OIM3640 Problem Solving & Software Design  - Term Project - 2025 Spring

---

## 1. Overview

From now until the end of the semester, you will work individually or in a team of two on a group software project. The final submission is due on **5/03**. Please carefully review the detailed deliverable requirements outlined below.

This is your chance to build something meaningful and practical - something you can proudly showcase after the course!

---

## 2. Project Topic

### Requirements:

- Since this course is (partially) called "Software Design," your project should include a substantial software component, focusing on designing and implementing a functional application.
- Your final project should be written primarily in Python. While it's acceptable for some parts to be written in other languages, the majority of the project must be implemented in Python.

### Suggestions for Project Topics:

- As the theme of this course is "Problem Solving," consider using this project to explore how computation can be applied to a discipline or problem you are passionate about. An interdisciplinary project may allow your software application to overlap with work you are doing in other courses (this is generally fine, but we would need to check with the other instructors to ensure it’s appropriate). If you pursue an interdisciplinary project, we may also be able to recruit a faculty adviser from the relevant field.
- If you're interested in working on a project **for** a client or organization, reach out to faculty, staff, or even family members who may have real-world problems or needs that you can help solve.
- Choose a project that makes a positive impact. Identify broken processes or systems and work on solutions.
- A good project should align with your personal learning goals. For example:
  - If you are interested in learning **web application development**, you might want to build a web application using frameworks like **Flask** or **FastAPI**. This can help you gain hands-on experience with back-end development, routing, and API creation.
  - If you are passionate about **automation**, consider developing a system that automates multiple workflows. For example, you could create an automation tool that integrates with various APIs to manage tasks across platforms (e.g., automating email responses, calendar scheduling, file backups to the cloud, and generating reports based on external data). The system could include error handling, notification systems, and a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring all automation tasks in real-time.
  - If you are interested in working with **AI**, create a project that integrates AI techniques to solve a problem, such as building a chatbot, or image classification using pre-trained AI models.
  - We suggest avoiding **games**, as they often focus more on graphics or interaction than on core software design and problem-solving.
- A strong project will have a well-defined **minimum viable product (MVP)** with opportunities for expansion depending on your team’s pace and enthusiasm.

## 3. Forming a Team

- Due: 4/07
- The project proposal is worth **3%** of the project grade.

### Requirements

- Your team should consist of no more than two students, although you may opt to work individually.
- Create a new **public** GitHub repository for your team project, with one team member as the owner and the other as a contributor. **Each team member must submit the URL of the project’s GitHub repository on Canvas.**
- At the beginning of the `README.md` file, list the names of all team members.
- (Optional) It’s recommended to create a Slack channel within our class workspace for easier project communication.
- Schedule a meeting with the professor, or communicate via email or Slack, to discuss potential project ideas before the next deadline.
  
### Tips for Team Formation

- Choose team members based on **shared interests** rather than only working with friends. This can lead to better collaboration and project outcomes.
- Work with people that want to **devote similar amounts of time to the project.** For instance, if you want to devote your life to making the best most awesomest project EVER, you should perhaps team up with someone with the same level of dedication and ambition!
- Work with people that **envision a similar style of work on the project.** For instance, if you want to pair-program the entire project, but your peers want to divide the labor and work independently, this probably isn't the greatest setup.

## 4. Project Activities / Deliverables

### 4.1 Project Proposal

- Due: 4/12
- The project proposal is worth **12%** of the project grade.

Your proposal should contain the following seven parts. The document doesn’t need to be long, but the more detail you provide, the better feedback we can give your team:

1. **The Big Idea**: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.
2. **Learning Objectives**: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
3. **Implementation Plan**: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.
4. **Project Schedule**: You have roughly 4-5 weeks to complete the project. Create a general timeline. Depending on your project, this could be a detailed schedule or just an overview. As the project progresses, you’ll likely need to revise this schedule.
5. **Collaboration Plan**: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.
6. **Risks and Limitations**: What do you think is the biggest risk to the success of your project?
7. **Additional Course Content**: Are there any course topics or content you think would be helpful for your project?

The proposal must be written using [markdown format](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). We recommend checking out [markdown-it demo](https://markdown-it.github.io) if you need more help with markdown syntax. You need to commit and push this proposal to your project’s GitHub repository, and **everyone on the team must submit the URL of the proposal to Canvas for grading purposes**.

<!-- You should also come to class with a printed version of this proposal. We will have about 10 minutes to meet with each team. You should designate one of the two team members to take notes. -->

When brainstorming your project idea, don't hesitate to explore different tools, including AI tools for ideation. These tools can help spark new ideas or refine your initial concept. However, it's important to ensure that the ideas generated by AI **align with your own interests or real-world problems you want to solve**. Think about contexts that are **unique to your experience** - for example, problems related to Babson’s entrepreneurial focus or your personal background. AI can be a useful tool, but avoid blindly following suggestions that don’t connect with the issues or passions that are meaningful to you.

### 4.2 Design Review

- Date:
- The design review is worth 10% of the project grade (see Technical Reviews page for detailed breakdown)
- **Note: Due to time constraints this semester, this component will not be required or counted toward your final grade.**

During the design review, three teams will present their project plans to a panel, and this interactive review format aims to bring out valuable/actionable feedback, rather than being a one-way data dump. In addition to the in-person component of this activity, the review will include a framing/agenda setting document to be submitted before the review date and a reflection/synthesis document after the review.

This review is **optional**, depending on time available, though maintaining communication with the professor is strongly recommended.

### 4.3 Code Review

- Date:
- The code review is worth 10% of the project grade (see Technical Reviews page for detailed breakdown)
- **Note: Due to time constraints this semester, this component will not be required or counted toward your final grade.**

During the code review, three teams will take turns presenting their code design and architecture to a panel. The review will employ the same interactive format as the design review and focus on soliciting useful/actionable feedback. Like the design review, there will be a framing/agenda setting document submitted before the review and a reflection/synthesis document after the review

This review is **optional**, depending on time available, but regular communication with the professor is recommended.

### 4.4 Mid-Project Presentation

- Date:
- The mid-project presentation is worth 10% of the project grade (see mid-project presentation rubric)
- **Note: Due to time constraints this semester, this component will not be required or counted toward your final grade.**

During your team's mid-project presentation, you'll present the project's progress thus far to the class. This presentation should be formal and well-rehearsed. Successful and professional communication will be the emphasis of this activity. There will be limited time for feedback given in class, although you can submit your feedback online using a feedback form.

This presentation is **optional**, depending on time available, though it’s recommended to maintain communication with the professor.

### 4.5 Project Website (or Detailed README)

- Due: 5/03
- The final website (or README) is worth **20%** of the project grade.
  
Your project website is the permanent record of your project's achievements and hopefully a valuable addition to your professional portfolio. You should use all of the above tasks and deliverables to create the final site, incorporating, reformatting, and adding to them to successfully tell the story of your project.

Alternatively, if your `README.md` is sufficiently detailed and comprehensive, it can substitute for creating a separate website. The README should include all necessary sections to explain your project's purpose, implementation, and results, just as a website would.

👉 For most students, a well-structured `README.md` is recommended over building a separate website.

The project website or detailed README can serve many audiences, including:

- Prospective and current students and faculty
- Parties interested in your project's topic and potential software users
- Future employers
  
There are many successful formats for a project website, but whether you choose to create a website or use a detailed README, consider including:

- **Big Idea/Goal/Why did we do this?**

    Can you give a quick and easy explanation of your project's purpose? Consider using a narrative or example use case, such as via screenshots, video, or storyboarding.

- **User Instructions/README**
  
    Provide guidance to users regarding downloading, installation, and initial use of your software. [Here](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) is a collection of incredible READMEs that can help you get started. [Here](https://readme.so/) is a website that helps you create a README.

- **Implementation Information**
  
    Code doesn't tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as flowcharts and architectural or class diagrams to explain how your code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to highlight a particularly crucial segment.

- **Results**
  
    Although each project will have unique details, showcasing your software's capabilities is essential! Screenshots and video can be especially useful. Include graphs and data, if appropriate.

- **Project Evolution/Narrative**
  
    By exploring how your project developed over time, you can convey an illustrious story about creating software that improved throughout the process. You might include screenshots or other tools to demonstrate the project's evolution.

- **Attribution**
  
    Ensure that you give appropriate credit for any external resources you used in your project.

**Note**: These prompts are intended to inspire your thinking, and you should choose whatever sections and organization make sense for your project and the story you're sharing. Merely answering the prompts one-by-one may not be the most effective way to communicate your work to an external audience. Whether you create a website or a detailed README, consider what you've accomplished and frame it in a visually appealing way - finish with a bang!

Your final project website may be implemented using whatever platform you like. You can continue to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or explore other options like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/pricing) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). All these platforms are free.

### 4.6 Code Submission

- Due: 5/03
- Project code is worth 35% of the project grade. Please refer to the Code Grading Rubric for more details.
  
Your project code must be submitted to GitHub. If there are any environment variables or other sensitive information that you've ignored in the GitHub repository, please email the professor with the necessary details.

As a part of your submission, include a **README.md** file that at least explains how to run your code. This should cover required dependencies, installation instructions, and any input files. We recommend taking a look at these resources like [Awesome READMEs](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) and [Readme.so](https://readme.so/) to help you get started on creating an informative README file.

Although it is optional for this project, proper documentation is essential to your final product. It would be best to generate documentation from the docstrings, and you can do this using tools such as [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/pydoc.html). If you want to generate truly beautiful documentation, check out [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) (the tool used to generate the Python documentation).

As part of your code development process, AI tools can be a great resource for debugging, reviewing code, suggesting improvements, or even generating small code snippets. While your project should be your own, leveraging AI to enhance productivity and solve specific problems can be beneficial, especially for repetitive or boilerplate tasks.

⚠️ **Important:** If you use AI to generate any part of your code, you must clearly state this in your README or project documentation. Be prepared to explain how the AI-generated code works during the evaluation.

### 4.7 Final Demo/Presentation Session

- Date: 4/29
  
We will have a demo session of your final projects. It is an opportunity for everyone to share their final projects, but it is **not part of the evaluation and is not mandatory**. We hope you'll take this chance to show off what you've created and celebrate your hard work with the class!
